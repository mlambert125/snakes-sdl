# Snakes in SDL

This is a simple snake game written in C using the SDL2 library. The game features a snake that moves around the screen,
collecting food and growing in length. The player controls the snake's direction using the arrow keys.

This was just a way for me to refamiliarize myself with SDL, and learn more modern C and build systems.
